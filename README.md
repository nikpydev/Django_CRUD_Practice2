# Django_CRUD_Practice
This is a Django app that has the CRUD (Create, Retrieve, Update and Delete) functionality implemented.
This uses CRUD for Schools' names, principal names, location names.
Everything is based on GUI here but for delete type basic_app/delete/<pk> as I have not yet used a form for it.
